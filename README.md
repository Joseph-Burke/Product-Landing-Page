# Product-Landing-Page
A repository for work related to freeCodeCamp's "Product Landing Page" project.

This freeCodeCamp project has the following requirements:

1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
2. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
3. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
8. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
9. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
12. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
14. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
